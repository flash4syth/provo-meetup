# Play with the tests in struct_tests.exs to see how they answer these questions:

1. Can I add or remove keys from a struct with `Map.put/3`, `Map.delete/2` after it is created?
2. What effect does `@enforce_keys` have on a struct?
3. How do maps and structs differ for retrieving values?
4. What happens when matching a plain map with a struct in a function signature?
5. What happens when matching a modified struct with a normal one in a function signature?
6. Can a map be configured to match a struct?
